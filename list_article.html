Malaysian Public Health Physicians Association president Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar said Targeted Enhanced MCO (TEMCO) should be considered in Selangor and the Klang Valley, which recorded a high number of daily cases. "The authorities should review and strengthen the current approach, especially in regard to public health intervention at primary care and community settings," he told the New Straits Times yesterday. Dr Zainal Ariffin said by implementing TEMCO in identified areas, the country's economic activities and essential business sectors would still be able to resume.</p></div>

                    <h2>Covid-19 Prevention: 12 Tips and Strategies</h2>
                    <h3>Tamam</h3>
                    <p>The new coronavirus is officially called SARS-CoV-2, which stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. An infection with this virus can lead to coronavirus disease 19, or COVID-19.

                        SARS-CoV-2 is related to the coronavirus SARS-CoV, which caused another kind of coronavirus disease in 2002 to 2003.

                        However, from what we know so far, SARS-CoV-2 is different from other viruses, including other coronaviruses.

                        The evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted more easily and cause life-threatening illness in some people.

                        Like other coronaviruses, it can survive in the air and on surfaces long enough for someone to contract it.

                        It’s possible that you could acquire SARS-CoV-2 if you touch your mouth, nose, or eyes after touching a surface or object that has the virus on it. However, this is not thought to be the main way that the virus spreads

                        However, SARS-CoV-2 multiplies faster in the body even when you don’t have symptoms. Additionally, you can transmit the virus even if you never get symptoms at all.

                        Some people have mild to moderate symptoms only, while others have severe COVID-19 symptoms.

                        Here are the medical facts to help us understand how to best protect ourselves and others.</p>

                    <h2>Impact of Lifestyle on Health</h2>
                    <h3>Harith</h3>
                    <p>Lifestyle is a way used by people, groups and nations and is formed in specific geographical, economic, political, cultural and religious text. Lifestyle is referred to the characteristics of inhabitants of a region in special time and place. It includes day to day behaviors and functions of individuals in job, activities, fun and diet.

                        In recent decades, life style as an important factor of health is more interested by researchers. According to WHO, 60% of related factors to individual health and quality of life are correlated to lifestyle (1). Millions of people follow an unhealthy lifestyle. Hence, they encounter illness, disability and even death. Problems like metabolic diseases, joint and skeletal problems, cardio-vascular diseases, hypertension, overweight, violence and so on, can be caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. The relationship of lifestyle and health should be highly considered.

                        Today, wide changes have occurred in life of all people. Malnutrition, unhealthy diet, smoking, alcohol consuming, drug abuse, stress and so on, are the presentations of unhealthy life style that they are used as dominant form of lifestyle. Besides, the lives of citizens face with new challenges. For instance, emerging new technologies within IT such as the internet and virtual communication networks, lead our world to a major challenge that threatens the physical and mental health of individuals. The challenge is the overuse and misuse of the technology.

                        Therefore, according to the existing studies, it can be said that: lifestyle has a significant influence on physical and mental health of human being. There are different forms of such influences. Consanguinity in some ethnicity is a dominant form of life style that it leads to the genetic disorders. Reformation of this unhealthy life style is a preventing factor for decreasing the rate of genetic diseases (2). In some countries, the overuse of drugs is a major unhealthy life style. Iran is one of the 20 countries using the most medications. They prefer medication to other intervention. Furthermore, in 15–40% of cases they use medications about without prescription (3). Pain relievers, eye drops and antibiotics have the most usage in Iran. While self-medications such as antibiotics have a negative effect on the immune system, if the individual would be affected by infection, antibiotics will not be effective in treatment. Overall, 10 percent of those who are self-medicated will experience severe complications such as drug resistance. Sometimes drug allergy is so severe that it can cause death (4).

                        With a look at existing studies in health domain, 9 key factors can be suggested for healthy life style (Fig. 1). In regard to each factor, the systematic planning in micro and macro level can be established. It can provide a social and individual healthy lifestyle.</p>
