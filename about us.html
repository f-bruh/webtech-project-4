        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>The world has been shocked by the emergence of coronavirus which is known as Covid-19 that began to spread since mid-December 2019. Looking at the current situation, the government of Malaysia has taken precautionary measures to prevent
          the spread of this Covid-19 virus by implementing a conditional movement control order (CMCO) where all citizens are required to stay at home and reduce outdoor activities. Staying at home may sound easy but if we do it in long periods of
          time, it can lead to stress and anxiety. Furthermore, nowadays many people may be working from home. Students, teachers, lecturers and parents are navigating this whole new world of e-learning. From here we know that all of us will have
          fewer social interactions and lack of physical exercise. This can have a negative effect on our mental and physical health.
        </p>

        <p>Therefore, we would like to take the initiative to create a website where people can easily access to get articles and videos on tips, advice or recommendations on what they should do and how they should take care of themselves at home.
          Our proposed website is a website that will provide media and articles on tips, advice and recommendation focusing on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle even though we are at home. Users can visit our website and also comment on our posts.
          If the users want to contact us, they can do it by filling in their details in the form provided in the web pages or if users want to get the latest news from our website, they can subscribe to our pages. Our aim is to encourage people who
          are bored or stressed at home by sharing some articles and videos related to activity that they can do, tutorials or tips that can help them reduce the stress with the uncertainty of when this Covid-19 will be over.
