WEB TECHNOLOGIES PROJECT - GROUP 4









1. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The world has been shocked by the emergence of coronavirus which is known as Covid-19 that
began to spread since mid-December 2019. Looking at the current situation, the government of
Malaysia has taken precautionary measures to prevent the spread of this Covid-19 virus by
implementing a conditional movement control order (CMCO) where all citizens are required to
stay at home and reduce outdoor activities. Staying at home may sound easy but if we do it in
long periods of time, it can lead to stress and anxiety. Furthermore, nowadays many people may
be working from home. Students, teachers, lecturers and parents are navigating this whole new
world of e-learning. From here we know that all of us will have fewer social interactions and
lack of physical exercise. This can have a negative effect on our mental and physical health.
Therefore, we would like to take the initiative to create a website where people can easily access
to get articles and videos on tips, advice or recommendations on what they should do and how
they should take care of themselves at home. Our proposed website is a website that will provide
media and articles on tips, advice and recommendation focusing on how to maintain a healthy
lifestyle even though we are at home. Users can visit our website and also comment on our posts.
If users also want to get the latest news from our website, they can subscribe to our pages by
filling in their details in the form provided in the web pages. Our aim is to encourage people who
are bored or stressed at home by sharing some articles and videos related to activity that they can
do, tutorials or tips that can help them reduce the stress with the uncertainty of when this
Covid-19 will be over.
